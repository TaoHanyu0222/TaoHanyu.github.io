<marquee style="position:relative;left:279px;top:-2504px;height:475px;" scrollamount="4" direction="down">It is sweet fantasy to say that all the myths, misinformation and ickiness surrounding female reproductive processes have been – finally – banished into the fusty past. It’s silly, really, because the word “hormonal” applies as much to a testosterone-charged City banker as it does to a woman about to have her period. The metabolic processes of all organisms can only take place in very specific chemical environments and, in the human body, hormones are special chemical messengers that, as part of the endocrine system, help to control most major bodily functions. Male, female, or anywhere on the spectrum of gender, hormones keep us alive. Yet “hormonal” is still a tool for explaining away a woman’s experience of her changing biochemistry. And so we try and keep schtum, lest we be slapped with such a historically damaging label: hysterical.</marquee>
<marquee style="position:relative;left:185px;top:-2907px;height:373px;" scrollamount="1" direction="down">When I effectively ran out of PMS treatment options, it made me realise how entrenched my analysis of my own thoughts and behaviour was in more general ideas of how I “should” or “shouldn’t” be as a woman. In therapy and in my psychological study, I realised how the workings of my inner world are often in collision with the outer world and all the expectations I perceive it to have of me. A better understanding of what goes on inside us, of the connection between our bodies and minds, is an important part of reclaiming meaning. We are not post-biology. We are protecting no one by pretending that we don’t bleed. We are not protecting ourselves by ignoring the external factors that may affect our bodily experiences, including the way modern medicine still doesn’t take the variance of women’s pain – or the voice describing that pain – seriously.</marquee>
<marquee style="position:relative;left:140px;top:-3200px;height:296px;" scrollamount="8" direction="down">Women can wait between four and 10 years after first seeing a doctor with symptoms of endometriosis and a diagnosis. The average is seven-and-a-half years. In 2017, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence released guidelines urging GPs not to overlook symptoms of the disorder, because for it to be repeatedly inferred that you are overreacting to your pain, your experience of that pain is going to become stained with confusion, fear and guilt. It is difficult to argue that medicine does not have an inherent bias against women. Women presenting at hospitals with pain are not only given fewer painkillers than men, but are often offered sedatives instead. Treatment for women with coronary heart disease is delayed compared to men. All these facts are corroborated by robust data. When a woman says how she feels, what she wants or what she needs, someone always knows better.</marquee>
<marquee style="position:relative;left:26px;top:-3500px;height:300px;" scrollamount="3" direction="down">Knowing ourselves better gives us the power to ask for better. For example, I used to panic sometimes at the pain I can have with ovulation. I knew I always felt it, but didn’t know why. Learning that mittelschmerz (the German words for “middle” and “pain”) is thought to be caused by one of our eggs rupturing through a sac (follicle) on an ovary, releasing fluid and a small amount of blood that can travel through the ovary wall and irritate nerves in the lining of the abdominal cavity, was a strange comfort. So, too, was learning from a prominent gynaecologist that he has seen women presenting in A&E in tears with acute pelvic pain, whose only clinically significant finding turns out to be recent ovulation. This shit is real and it hurts. What’s sad is that my private experience alone didn’t feel like good enough evidence to finally ask for pain relief.</marquee>
<marquee style="position:relative;left:22px;top:-3800px;height:253px;" scrollamount="6" direction="down">On some level, a focus on a woman’s changing biochemistry throughout her cycle – or any other reproductive process – might be seen to remove some of the stigma. It’s just my hormones. That there could be a clear, chemical “reason” for a certain type of behaviour or way of feeling is, on the surface, legitimising and reassuring. Although, if any woman is able to ride out days of feeling low each month by being aware of her cycle patterns; or finds that telling herself that the way she’s feeling is “just chemical” is a strategy that stops her going up into that second gear of self-analysis and existential woe, I absolutely lift my hat to her. Personally, given what I now know about the imprecision of the science of how our hormones can affect our mood, I try to resist thinking that I am a chemically controlled robot. I try to see my distress as part of a mini-ecosystem that includes my changing hormones, asking myself: what else is going on to upset my mind? How physically well am I right now? What helps?</marquee>
<marquee style="position:relative;left:211px;top:-4040px;height:325px;" scrollamount="7" direction="down">Research tells us that our hormonal fluctuations do seem to affect how chemical signals pass through our brain – as any neuroscientist would tell you, we just don’t know exactly how or why. In all fields of brain study it is accepted that mental distress is not caused by one thing in isolation. The electrical, chemical brain is not extricable from the subjective mind. What we talk about is multi-causality: a fancy word for the concept that lots of different factors contribute to how we feel mentally. Therefore, when we talk about processes happening in a woman’s body that place us at “increased risk” of depression or anxiety, it seems not just blindingly logical, but respectful to consider that body in the wider scheme of things.

<marquee style="position:relative;left:203px;top:-4400px;height:481px;" scrollamount="5" direction="down">Perhaps, then, a more realistic phrase than, “It’s just my hormones,” would be, “My hormones might predispose me to feeling terrible sometimes.”

<marquee style="position:relative;left:107px;top:-4900px;height:330px;" scrollamount="2" direction="down">Our fluctuating biology is not the whole story but a significant part of our emotional lives. The hormonal changes and symptoms of menopause are very real and can be very hard. When my hormone levels change, notably at ovulation (soaring oestrogen) and in the week before I get my period (soaring progestogen, high oestrogen), it really can feel like I’ve stepped inside the skin of a different person – that I am not myself. But what is “myself” if not a sensitive-by-design brain and body that is always changing and responding to the world it inhabits and the people around it? From what fixed, ideal state do I feel I am slipping when I am more emotional for the second half of the month?</marquee>
<marquee style="position:relative;left:132px;top:-5205px;height:331px;" scrollamount="5" direction="down">As human beings, rhythm is part of our deep core. Breathing, pumping, contracting: these are all actions of the body that keep us alive and keep our species going. Menstruation is another rhythm unique to women. But while our biology and what is happening inside us is important, we cannot act as if the body is an anatomical drawing floating in space; that it is nowhere. Clearly, if a woman’s premenstrual distress is such that she feels unable to function, she should, in an ideal world, be receiving dedicated healthcare and support. Is there something wider we should be asking about how, as a society, we frame what women say and do when they are anything other than sanguine, nurturing and polite?</marquee>
<marquee style="position:relative;left:57px;top:-5500px;height:94px;" scrollamount="5" direction="down">Are we saving up anger, our base need for affection, and our tears for three weeks of the month? As our hormonal levels shift, could they be acting as a kind of “truth serum”, lubricating the passage of what we really want to say or do? It’s a radical idea and I quite like it. What if what we feel during those times of the month when we are so quick to say we are being irrational is the most “real” we are? The science surrounding whatever signalling changes happen in the emotion-processing parts of our brain during the menstrual cycle is too fuzzy to definitively say otherwise. Could it be that, when the mantle of self-censorship drops and we are less caught up with fearing how we’ll be seen, we’re accessing all that historical oppression and, in short bursts, letting it go? All that so-called “excess”, the stuff that makes a woman “hysterical” could just be… truth.</marquee>
